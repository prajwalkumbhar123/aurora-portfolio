# aurora-portfolio
This website is a highly interactive, neo-futuristic portfolio built with HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling, GLSL (via OGL) for a GPU-accelerated aurora background, and JavaScript (via GSAP) for high-performance 3D magnetic project cards and spark particle effects.

🚀 Interactive Neo-Futuristic Portfolio
A high-performance, single-page personal website featuring advanced WebGL shaders, GPU-accelerated animations, and interactive UI components. Built as a seamless integration of modern web technologies to showcase development projects with a focus on User Experience (UX).

🛠️ Tech Stack
-> Markup: HTML5 (Semantic structure)

-> Styling: CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Glassmorphism, Keyframe Animations)

-> Logic: JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)

-> Animation Engine: GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

-> Rendering: OGL (Minimal WebGL library)

-> Shader Language: GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) for GPU rendering


🚀 Getting Started
Clone this repository or download the index.html file.

Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

Ensure you have an active internet connection to load the GSAP and OGL libraries via CDN.

🎨 Customization
Colors: Update the --glow-color and uColorStops in the shader logic to change the theme from "Aurora Green" to any palette.

Speed: Adjust the uTime multiplier in the JavaScript render loop to speed up or slow down the background flow.
